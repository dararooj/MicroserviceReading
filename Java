JDK(java development kit) is a software development environment which is used to develope software
applications.It is plateform independent. It exists physically.It contains JRE and development tools.
JDK contains its JVM, compiler,jar etc to complete the development of jave applications.
JRE(java runtime environment) is a set of software tools which are used for java development applications.
It provides runtime environment. It physically exists.It contains JVM and other libraries.
JVM(java virtual machine) is a abstract machine.It is called virtual machine because it does not
physically exists.It is a specification that provides runtime environment in which java byte codes
are executed. It also runs other programs written in other languages and compiled in java byte codes.
There are three notations in JVM:
